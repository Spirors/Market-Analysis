## Hard-rule propagation: `project-rules` skill, not AGENTS.md alone

`AGENTS.md` auto-injects into the parent orchestrator's system prompt but
**not** into OMO-slim subagent sessions (`@fixer`, `@explorer`, `@oracle`,
`@designer`, etc.). Handing the rules through the dispatch prompt is the
only reliable cross-context path. The pattern:

1. Hard rules live in `.opencode/skills/project-rules/SKILL.md`.
2. `AGENTS.md` "During Work" instructs the orchestrator to invoke that
   skill (`skill` tool) before any subagent dispatch and include the
   output in the subagent's prompt string.
3. Subagents receive the rules as immediate task context, not as static
   background.

Keep the skill and AGENTS.md's "Hard rules" section in sync — they are
deliberately the same content in two places, because the skill survives
subagent dispatch while AGENTS.md survives session restart.
